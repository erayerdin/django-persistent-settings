# Django Persistent Settings

Django Persistent Settings helps you store, retrieve and update platform specific settings in Django and provides many ways in setting retrieval such as request injection or template tags. It is inspired by Laravel's [akaunting/setting](https://github.com/akaunting/setting) package.
